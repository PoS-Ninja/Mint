# Mint ðŸŒ±

A dependency manager that installs and runs Swift command line tool packages.

```
$ mint run yonaskolb/xcodegen 1.2.0 xcodegen
```

Mint is designed to be used with command line tools that use the Swift Package Manager.

- âœ… run tools **without build files** like homebrew formulas
- âœ… builds are **cached** globally by version
- âœ… easily run a specific **version** of a tool
- âœ… use **different versions** of a tool side by side


## Why is it called Mint?
Swift Packager Manager Tools -> SPMT -> Spearmint -> Mint! ðŸŒ±ðŸ˜„

## Installing
Make sure Xcode 9 is installed first.

### Make

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint.git
$ cd mint
$ make
```

### Homebrew

```
$ brew tap yonaskolb/mint https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint.git
$ brew install mint
```

### Swift Package Manager

**Use CLI**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint.git
$ cd mint
$ ./build/release/mint
```

**Use as dependency**

Add the following to your Package.swift file's dependencies:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint.git", from: "0.1.0"),
```

And then import wherever needed: `import MintKit`

## Usage

Run `mint` to see usage instructions.

```
$ mint
Usage:
  mint [command]

Available Commands:
  install  Install a package
  run      Run a package
  update   Update a package
  
Use "mint [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

- **Install**: Installs a package. If it is already installed this won't do anything
- **Run**: Runs a package. This will install if first if it doesn't exist
- **Update**: Installs a package while enforcing an update and rebuild. Shouldn't be required unless you are pointing at a branch and want to update.

These 3 commands use the same flags. They must all be followed by a repo name.
This can be a shorthand for a github repo `install realm/SwiftLint` or a fully qualified git path `install https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint.git`.

##### Repo
In the case of `run` you can also just pass the name of the repo if it is already installed `run swiftlint`. This will do a lookup of all installed packages.

#### Version
By default the version that is used is the latest git tag (or master if no tags exist). You can pass a specific version with the version flag (-v, --version) eg. `--version 1.2.0`

#### Name
By default the tool name will be the last path in the repo (so for `realm/swiftlint` it will be `swiftlint`). If there are any packages that have a different executable name when build you can specify it with `--name`

#### Arguments
To pass in arguments to the final tool on `run` you need to use `--args="any arguments"`

#### Examples
```
$ mint install yonaskolb/xcodegen 1.2.0 --args="--spec my_spec.yml"
$ mint install yonaskolb/xcodegen
$ mint run xcodegen
```

## Package.resources
As the Swift Packager doesn't yet have a way of specifying resources directories, Mint looks for a custom `Package.resources` file in the repo. This is a plain text file that lists the resources directories on different lines:

```
MyFiles
MyOtherFiles
```
If a file such as this is found, then all those directories will be copied into the same path as the executable.
